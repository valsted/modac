                Motivated by recent advancements in open-ended research, and the utilization of stepping stones to unlock potential in genetic algorithms, this thesis presents the Multi-Objective Difficulty Adjusting Coevolution (MODAC) algorithm. MODAC utilizes innovation
                protection to preserve stepping stones uncovered as part of a coevolutionary process in a paired agent-environment setting. It simultaneously generates progressively complex environments and their solutions, approximating aspects of an
                open-ended process, where many concurrent branches of agent policies proliferate. It does this by evolving a pool of environments alongside agents, where the difficulty of the environments are adjusted according to the capabilities of
                the agents. MODAC provides new insight into the capabilities of the innovation protection mechanism, with experiments showing it has positive effect when applied to both problem and problem solver. However, the benefit is minor compared
                to previous work. It was observed that the application of innovation protection lead to better utilization of the coevolved environment pool, ultimately leading to slightly more general agent policies. The most complex environments evolved
                by MODAC were solved by a simple genetic algorithm. This shows that MODAC is not able to generate challenges that can not be directly optimized towards. However, the general performance of the agents evolved through direct optimization
                was inferior to those evolved by MODAC. All in all, MODAC showed that innovation protection can be beneficial when applied to a domain where both the problem and the solution require reduced selection pressure. Additionally, dynamically
                adjusting the difficulty of generated environments led to the discovery of more general solutions.
